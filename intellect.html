	<i>Part 1</i>: Play the Game<br>
	You must play one day's worth of ATLAS Project to succeed. Have you played the ATLAS Project today?<br>
	<button id="PlayYes" type="button">Yes</button>   <button id="PlayNo" type="button">No</button>
	You have played the game <span id="PlayYes"></span> times, and failed to play the game <span id="PlayNo"></span> times.<br>
	That works out to a rate of <span id="PlayRate"></span>. Make of that what you will.<br><br>
	<i>Part 2</i>: Develop the Game <br>
	You must develop, update or improve the game in some minor way (at least) every day. Have you developed the ATLAS Project today? <br>
	<button id="DevYes" type="button">Yes</button> <button id="DevNo" type="button">No</button>
	You have worked on the game <div class="DevYesDiv"></div> times, and failed to work on the game <div class="DevNoDiv"></div> times.<br>
	That works out to a rate of <div class="DevRateDiv"></div>. Make of that what you will.<br><br>
