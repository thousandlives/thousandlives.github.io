  <b>Intellect</b><br><br>
  <i>Part 1</i>: Play the Game <br>
  You must play one day's worth of ATLAS Project to succeed. Have you played the ATLAS Project today? <br>
  <button id="PlayYes" type="button">Yes</button>   <button id="PlayNo" type="button">No</button>
  You have played the game <div class="PlayYesDiv"></div> times, and failed to play the game <div class="PlayNoDiv"></div> times.<br>
  That works out to a rate of <div class="PlayRateDiv"></div>. Make of that what you will.<br><br>
  <i>Part 2</i>: Develop the Game <br>
  You must develop, update or improve the game in some minor way (at least) every day. Have you developed the ATLAS Project today? <br>
  <button id="DevYes" type="button">Yes</button> <button id="DevNo" type="button">No</button>
  You have worked on the game <div class="DevYesDiv"></div> times, and failed to work on the game <div class="DevNoDiv"></div> times.<br>
  That works out to a rate of <div class="DevRateDiv"></div>. Make of that what you will.<br><br>
