	You have played the game <span id="PlayYesCount">ERROR</span> times, and failed to play the game <span id="PlayNoCount">ERROR</span> times.<br>
	That works out to a rate of <span id="PlayRate">ERROR</span>%. Make of that what you will.<br>

	<h2><i>Part 2</i>: Develop the Game</h2><br>
	You must develop, update or improve the game in some minor way (at least) every day. Have you developed the ATLAS Project today? <br>
