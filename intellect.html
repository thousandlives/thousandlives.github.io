  <i>Part 1</i>: Play the Game <br>
  You must play one day's worth of ATLAS Project to succeed. Have you played the ATLAS Project today? <br>
  <button id="PlayYes" type="button">Yes</button> <div class="PlayYesDiv"></div>     <button id="PlayNo" type="button">No</button> <div class="PlayNoDiv"></div><br>
  I don't know how many times you've won or lost, because I don't know what PlayYesDiv or PlayNoDiv are. I also don't know if you've played today. Oh well. <br><br>
  <i>Part 2</i>: Develop the Game <br>
  You must develop, update or improve the game in some minor way (at least) every day. Have you developed the ATLAS Project today? <br>
  <button id="DevYes" type="button">Yes</button> <div class="DevYesDiv"></div> <button id="DevNo" type="button">No</button> <div class="DevNoDiv"></div><br>
  I don't know how many times you've won or lost, because I don't know what DevYesDiv or DevNoDiv are. I also don't know if you've developed anything today. Oh well. <br><br>
